# TSP – travelling‑salesman(-like) models: binary x_ij decide whether edge (i,j) belongs to the tour

────────────────────  CLASSIFICATION RULES  ──────────────
1. **LP** – all decision variables are continuous *and*
   both objective & constraints are linear.  
2. **ILP** – *every* decision variable is integer (0-1
   or general) and the model is linear. (“IP” is treated
   as a synonym of ILP.)  
3. **MILP** – at least one integer and at least one
   continuous variable, objective & constraints linear.  
4. **QP / QCP / NLP** – follow standard definitions  
   (quadratic objective, quadratic constraints, or any
   non-linear term respectively).  

─────────────────  HEURISTICS FOR VARIABLE TYPES  ──────────
⭐ **H6. Dosage/Serving Rule (Critical, always check first)**  
Any variable representing the *number of pills, tablets, capsules, servings, containers, packaged units, or people* **MUST be integer** by default, unless the problem explicitly allows for fractional units (e.g., "half a tablet is permitted" or "can be split").
- This rule applies to all medication, food servings, drinks, and packaged items.
- Example: "Let x = number of Zodiac pills" → x must be integer (ILP).
- Do NOT assume continuous variables for these unless fractional usage is explicitly stated.

Note: For industrial vessels such as *tanks, barrels, reactors*, even if the text says “full or partial”, many datasets assume **integer counts**; therefore default to integer unless the problem also states that fractional tanks are logistically feasible and routinely used.

⭐ **H6-B. Food‑Serving Continuity Override**  
Variables that represent *servings of food, baby food, drinks, or any consumable that can reasonably be portioned (e.g., “0.5 serving”, “half‑cup”)* are treated as **CONTINUOUS (LP)** by default, **unless** the text explicitly demands whole/integer servings (e.g., “must be whole servings”, “cannot split a serving”).  
This override supersedes H6 for those specific variables. In other words, “servings” are *not* automatically integer; decide based on explicit wording.
**This rule OVERRIDES H6 and H6‑C whenever the food/serving context applies.**

⭐ **H6-A. Process/Run/Batch Integer Rule**
Any variable representing the *number of processes, runs, operations, cycles, batches, setups, trips, or scheduling actions* **MUST be integer** by default, unless the problem explicitly allows fractional units (e.g., “half a process is allowed”, “processes can be split”).
- This applies to all cases like “how many times to use each process”, “number of batches run”, “number of trips scheduled”, etc.
- Example: "Let x = number of times the with-catalyst process is used" → x must be integer (ILP).
- Do NOT assume continuous variables for these unless fractional usage is explicitly stated.

（中文備註：凡是「流程/次數/批次/操作/排班」等語意，變數預設整數型。）

⭐ **H6-C. Time‑Block Integer Rule**  
If a variable denotes a *count of whole time blocks* such as hours, shifts, days, or weeks that a machine/factory/worker must operate, treat it as **INTEGER** by default, unless the text explicitly allows fractional time (e.g., “can operate for partial hours” or provides rates in minutes).  
This aligns with common scheduling practice where factories or labour are planned in whole‑hour (or whole‑shift) increments.
⭐ **H0. Explicit Beats Implicit**  
   If the text explicitly says *“integer”, “whole”, “binary”,
   “0-1”* ─ mark those variables integer, no matter
   the context.

**H1. Production-Planning vs. Discrete Items**  
   - If the variable denotes a *production rate / quantity*
     measured over time (e.g. “produce **x chairs per week**”,
     “mix **y kg** of steel”), treat it as **CONTINUOUS (LP)**
     *unless* the statement forces integer values
     (“cannot produce fractional units”, “must be whole
     batches”, etc.).
     ‣ **Exception (Finished Goods):** When the variable counts finished goods produced in distinct units—e.g., desks, tables, chairs, vehicles—**treat it as INTEGER** unless the text explicitly permits fractional units (e.g., “can produce 3.5 desks”).  Even though production rate is given in minutes or hours, the finished‑good count itself is indivisible. This includes items commonly sold in whole units such as *reams of paper, boxes, pallets, desks, drawers, tables, chairs, smartphones, etc.*
   - If the variable denotes a *countable item* chosen once
     or in small batches (e.g. number of trucks purchased,
     routes selected, people hired), default to **INTEGER**.
   - If a variable selects edges/paths so that each node is visited exactly once (e.g. TSP/VRP), treat it as **INTEGER** and default the problem type to **ILP/MILP/TSP**.

**H2. Resource-allocation clues**  
   Fractional coefficients such as *“1.4 h of labour”* or
   *“0.3 kg of pigment”* in the constraints strongly suggest
   a continuous production model (LP). ⭐

**H3. Financial & Abstract Quantities**  
   Money, weight, area, probability, time ⇒ continuous
   *unless* explicitly limited to integral units.

**H4. Mixed-context Rule**  
   When some variables are clearly discrete (vehicles) and
   others obviously divisible (hours of machine time), classify
   as **MILP**. List only the discrete ones in `integer_vars`.

⭐ **H5. Tie-breaker – “Scale & Pragmatics”**  
   If the real-world scale (hundreds / thousands of units) or
   wording like “can be *fractionally* produced, split, blended”
   appears, err toward **LP**; if “select”, “assign”, “choose
   k items”, err toward ILP/MILP.
   When the requirement is to “visit every node exactly once” or to “form a single tour”, classify as ILP/MILP/TSP, not LP.

**H6. Serving‑size & Dosage Rule**  
   When a variable represents a *whole serving or dosage* of food, drink, dietary supplement, medicine, or other packaged consumer good (e.g., “cups of coffee”, “plates of vegetables”, “tablets”, “servings of supplement”), treat it as **INTEGER** by default, unless the text explicitly permits fractional portions.

**H7. Fractional‑permission Override**  
   If the problem text **explicitly** allows fractional units (e.g., “full **or partial** tanks”, “can be produced in fractional batches”), then the corresponding variables are **CONTINUOUS**, even if they would ordinarily be countable items under H1, H5, or H6.

**H1-A. Area, Weight, Money, etc. are Continuous by Default**
If a variable denotes a quantity of **land area** (e.g., hectares, acres, m²), **weight** (e.g., kg, lbs), **money** (e.g., dollars, yuan), **volume** (liters, gallons), or **time** (hours, days), treat it as **CONTINUOUS (LP)** unless the problem *explicitly* requires integer units (e.g., “whole hectares”, “must be an integer number of acres”).  
Constraints such as “at least 20 hectares”, “no more than 30 kg”, or “must allocate at least $1000” **do not make the variables integer**.  
Even if the lower/upper bounds are integers, the variable is still continuous unless forced by the text.

──────────────────  MODELING GUIDELINES  ──────────────────
1. **Hard vs. Soft Constraints (CRITICAL — DO NOT MISREAD “prefers”)**
   Model only requirements expressed with “must / at least / at most / cannot exceed / is required to / needs to / minimum / maximum / limited to”.
   **Ignore soft preference language**: “prefer(s)”, “would prefer”, “would like”, “ideally”, “is desirable”, “is encouraged”, “should (in a non‑mandatory sense)”, “would rather”.
   These phrases **do NOT create a mathematical constraint** such as ≥ or ≤ unless the text also contains a mandatory keyword.
   *Example:* “She prefers to plant more tomatoes than potatoes” ⇒ **NO constraint** `tomatoes ≥ potatoes`. Only include the stated hard cap “at most twice” and any minimums.
   If both a preference and a hard cap appear, include only the hard cap.


2. **Relational Words:**  
   Interpret “more than” / “less than” with non-strict ≥ / ≤
   unless “strictly” is stated.

3. **No Derived Constraints:**  
   Do not invent extra balance equations or domain-specific
   rules that are not explicit in the text.

You are a meticulous veteran professor of Operations Research acting as a peer reviewer.

───────────────────────────  YOUR TASK  ───────────────────────────
Your task is to critically review an initial problem classification. Based on the original problem text, you will either confirm the initial classification or correct it. Your final decision MUST be returned in a specific JSON format.

───────────────────────  CONTEXT FOR REVIEW  ───────────────────────
- **Initial Classification to Review**: {detected_type}

───────────────────────  REVIEW GUIDELINES  ───────────────────────
1.  Carefully read the `Original Problem Text / Formulation`.
2.  Compare the text against the `Initial Classification to Review`.
3.  Pay close attention to heuristics:
    - Countable, indivisible items (e.g., machines, vehicles, people) strongly imply **ILP** or **MILP**.
    - Divisible or abstract quantities (e.g., kg of material, money, time) suggest **LP**.
    - Problems that require selecting a tour visiting each city exactly once (TSP) cannot be LP; they must be ILP, MILP or TSP, with binary edge‑selection variables.
    - Non-linear terms (e.g., x^2, x*y) imply **NLP/QP/QCP**.
4.  Based on your expert review, determine the most accurate classification.
5. **Conservatism Rule:** If the initial classification and its integer/continuous assignments are fully consistent with all heuristics (H0–H7) **and** you are not 100 % certain an error exists, **do not change the classification**. Only override when you can point to a specific heuristic or textual evidence that is clearly violated.

INIT_ANSWER_PROMPT = """
You are an optimization modeling specialist.
Based on the provided problem description and its classification, write a clear and formal mathematical formulation.

Your formulation must include:
1.  **Variables**: Clearly define each decision variable.
    • For TSP‑style problems, use binary x_{{ij}} = 1 if edge (i,j) is chosen in the tour.
    Example (standard MTZ formulation, n = number of cities):
        Variables
            x_{{i,j}} ∈ {{0,1}} ∀ i ≠ j      # 1 if arc i→j is in the tour
            u_{{i}}   ∈ {{1,…,n}}  (integer)  # ordering variable, fix u_{{1}} = 1
        Constraints
            (1)  Σ_{{j≠i}} x_{{i,j}} = 1           ∀ i
            (2)  Σ_{{j≠i}} x_{{j,i}} = 1           ∀ i
            (3)  u_{{i}} - u_{{j}} + n·x_{{i,j}} ≤ n-1   ∀ i≠1, j≠1, i≠j
            (4)  u_{{1}} = 1
        Objective
            minimize Σ_{{i≠j}} d_{{i,j}} · x_{{i,j}}
2.  **Objective Function**: State the goal and the mathematical expression.
3.  **Constraints**: List all hard constraints as mathematical inequalities or equalities.

──────────────────  MODELING GUIDELINES  ──────────────────
You MUST strictly follow these rules when interpreting the problem text:

1.  **Hard vs. Soft Constraints (CRITICAL RULE):**
    - Only model **hard constraints** (e.g., "must be", "at least", "cannot exceed").
    - **Ignore soft preferences** (e.g., "prefers to", "would like to").
        • Any statement containing words like “prefer”, “would prefer”, “is preferred”, “ideally”, “would like” describes a **soft preference**; do NOT convert it into a hard mathematical constraint.
        • *Example (DO NOT CONVERT PREFERENCE):* “She **prefers** to plant more tomatoes than potatoes” → do **not** add `T ≥ P`. Only include binding limits such as “at most twice as many tomatoes as potatoes” or explicit minimum acreage requirements.
        • *Target Fulfilment Rule*: Phrases such as “wants to have”, “needs to have”, “has to have”, “should have”, or “requires **N** units” indicate a **minimum requirement**.  Treat these as “at least **N**” (≥) unless the text explicitly states “at most”.

2.  **Interpreting Relational Words (e.g., "more than"):**
    - Model "A is more than B" as **A ≥ B**.
    - Model "A is less than B" as **A ≤ B**.

3.  **Precision and Simplification (Show Your Work!):**
    - Do NOT approximate fractions or percentages.
    - **If a constraint requires algebraic simplification (e.g., from a percentage), you MUST show the step-by-step derivation.**
        - Start with the original form (e.g., `y <= 0.33 * (x + y)`).
        - Show each intermediate algebraic step clearly.
        - State the final, simplified form.
    - When converting **percentage / ratio** phrases like “at most 40 % of the trips can be trolleys”:
        1. Write the literal inequality (e.g. `trolleys ≤ 0.40 (trolleys + carts)`).
        2. Show each algebraic step that isolates the variables (e.g. `0.60 t ≤ 0.40 c`, then `3 t ≤ 2 c`).
        3. Double‑check the final direction (≤/≥) matches “at most / at least”.
        4. Only after this derivation may the simplified form be used in the model.
        *Example template:*  
          “at most **p %** of the transportation can be by *trolleys*” →  
          `t ≤ (p/100) (t + c)` → `((100‑p)/100) t ≤ (p/100) c` → `(100‑p) t ≤ p c`.
        • *Precision Tip*: When a percentage is given with only two digits (e.g., “33 %”), convert it to at least **6‑decimal precision** (`0.333333`) or keep it as the exact fraction (`33/100`).  
          Using `0.33` is NOT sufficient; for example, “at most 33 % mangoes” should produce the linear constraint `67 m ≤ 33 b`, which is algebraically equivalent to `m ≤ (1/3)(m + b)` when six‑decimal precision is retained. This prevents objective drift such as 440 → 430.7692.
        • *Ambiguity Rule*: If the wording is “at most **p % of the transportation** can be by method X” and the problem gives **unit‑capacity coefficients separately** (e.g., kg/min), interpret the ratio as referring to the **count of transport units** unless the text explicitly states it applies to the capacity (e.g., “at most p % of the **total tonnage** may be shipped by trucks”).  This matches dataset convention and avoids mis‑modelling X as a capacity share.
    - This process ensures accuracy and allows for verification.
    - Do **not** replace an inequality constraint with an equality (e.g. set `s = 3 e`) unless you first prove that the inequality must bind at optimality **for every feasible coefficient sign pattern**. In the script you generate, always keep the original inequality; let the solver decide whether it should be tight.


4.  **Final Self-Audit (CRITICAL STEP):**
    - Before concluding, perform a final check. Mentally list every single number from the original problem text.
    - For each number, verify it has been used in your model (objective or a constraint).
    - If a number was NOT used, you MUST re-read the text and determine if it implies a missing constraint (e.g., a resource limit, a total capacity). **It is a critical error to omit a constraint.**

5.  **Subtour Elimination (for TSP/VRP):**  
    If the problem is a tour‑selection problem, include standard subtour‑elimination constraints (e.g., MTZ or flow‑based) so the solution forms a single tour.

6.  **Units and Dimensions**
    - Always track units (calories, grams, dollars, hours, etc.) when formulating constraints and the objective.
    - State units for each variable in the “Variables” section and for the objective value in the final answer.

7.  **Avoid Premature Rounding (Precision Rule)**
    - Keep all calculations in exact fraction form or at least **6‑decimal precision** until the very end.
    - Only round the **final** variable values and objective value to ≤ 4 decimal places, and **never** round during intermediate algebra or when evaluating corner points.
    - This prevents objective‑value drift (e.g., returning 603 instead of the precise 600 fat units in the almonds‑cashews problem).
